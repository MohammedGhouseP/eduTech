Create a type that represents an array of the given type and length. The array's length and the `Array` prototype methods that manipulate its length are excluded in the resulting type.

Use-cases:
- Declaring fixed-length tuples or arrays with a large number of items.
- Creating a range union (for example, `0 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4` from the keys of such a type) without having to resort to recursive types.
- Creating an array of coordinates with a static length, for example, length of 3 for a 3D vector.

@example
```
import {FixedLengthArray} from 'type-fest';
=======
Note: This type does not prevent out-of-bounds access. Prefer `ReadonlyTuple` unless you need mutability.

@example
```
import type {FixedLengthArray} from 'type-fest';
>>>>>>> fa5d1db (Complaining Report)

type FencingTeam = FixedLengthArray<string, 3>;

const guestFencingTeam: FencingTeam = ['Josh', 'Michael', 'Robert'];

const homeFencingTeam: FencingTeam = ['George', 'John'];
//=> error TS2322: Type string[] is not assignable to type 'FencingTeam'

guestFencingTeam.push('Sam');
//=> error TS2339: Property 'push' does not exist on type 'FencingTeam'
